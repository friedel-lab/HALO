<h2>The settings menu</h2>
The settings menu allows you to enter a number of constant values, so that you do not have to input these at 
every relevant point. You can always change these values.


<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Set alpha function</span></h3>
In the current version (1.3) you can choose between two different alpha functions that are used for half-life 
calculation. The first of these is the default method, which always returns 1. The second method models the cell 
division; for this method you have to enter the numerical parameter <code>ccl</code> (cell cycle length).

<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Set labeling time</span></h3>
Here you can enter a constant labeling time that will be used for all subsequent analyses, e.g. half-life 
calculations.

<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Set path to R</span></h3>
For <a href="menuquality.html">quality control</a> you have to have <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R</a>
installed. You can enter the path to it's bin folder here.

<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Set maximum/minimum half-life</span></h3>
For ratios equal to or larger than 1 the half-life calculation is difficult, resulting in negative or <code>NaN</code> values. This problem is avoided by defining a maximum and minimum half-life. Default values for this are 10000 for maximum half-life and 5 for minimum half-life. You can customize these values with this menu point.

<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Set replicate</span></h3>
If you want to keep using only one replicate for all your analyzes, you can enter its number (starting from 1) here 
and won't have to enter it every time.

<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Set gene name attribute label</span></h3>
Per default the label of the gene name attribute is set to <code>gene_name</code>, which may differ from the label 
in your data. When you load a multiple fasta file or try to filter according to PQS values, for which gene names 
are needed, you will be asked to change the label to one that fits your data. You can also use this menu point to 
change it previously.
