<h2>Normalization with the GUI</h2>
If you want to calculate half-life values for your data, you first have to determine correction 
factors for the normalization. For this purpose the HALO GUI provides the Normalization menu, where 
you can choose between a set of methods for the normalization of your data. 

<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Extending the menu</span></h3>
Normalization is available after you have loaded the data. 
You can access the menu by through clicking the menu option 
labeled <span style="font-weight: bold;">Normalization</span> from the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Normalization</span> menu in the menu bar. 

<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Normalization methods</span></h3>
In the current version (1.3) you can choose between two normalization methods; if you have loaded 
data in unequal numbers only the second of these is accessible. 

<ul>
	<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Linear Regression</span><br>
	This method performs normalization through a simple linear regression. You can choose between 
	calculating the ratio over the average of all replicates (default), the average over the ratios for each 
	replicate or one replicate alone for this procedure. </li>
	
	<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Median half-life based</span><br>
	This method is based on a median half-life that you have to calculate separately and can enter 
	in the popup dialog. You will have to choose at least one half-life calculation method, labeling time and 
	(optionally) a replicate for the ratio calculation in this method. </li>
</ul>

In order to start the process you have to click the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Start</span> button.
Your resulting correction factors will then be displayed and used automatically for the half-life calculation.

<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Plotting the results</span></h3>
If you have chosen linear regression as normalization method, you have the possibility to plot the results.
In the graph your data will be shown as scatter plot (blue), and the linear regression line will be displayed in 
red. This procedure might take a couple of seconds. You can save this graph or the values as a plotting file.
You can always save plots and change properties through right clicking in the figure. 

<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Subsequent steps</span></h3>
Normalization unlocks the <a href="menumedian.html">Half-Life</a> menu in the menu bar.
