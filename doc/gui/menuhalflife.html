<h2>Half-life calculation with the GUI</h2>
After loading and normalizing the data you can calculate the half-lives. 

<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Extending the menu</span></h3>
You have to load the data and perform normalization before you can access the half-life 
calculation menu. After doing so you can extend the panel through simply clicking on the 
menu labeled <span style="font-weight: bold;">Half-Life calculation</span> in the <b>Half-Life</b>
menu of the menu bar or by pressing Ctrl+H.

<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Adding Half-life calculations</span></h3>
In the current version (1.3) three methods for half-life calculations are implemented. You 
can include as many different methods as you want through subsequent clicking on the 
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Add calculation</span> button. A popup dialog will 
appear where you can choose between the three methods:

<ul>
	<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Newly transcribed/Total based</span><br>
	This method uses the ratio of newly transcribed to total RNA and the correction factor c_l for half-life
	calculation.</li>
	
	<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Pre-existing/Total based</span><br>
	For this method the ratio of pre-existing RNA to total is used, as well as the correction 
	factor c_u.</li>
	
	<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Newly transcribed/Pre-existing based</span><br>
	The last method uses the ratio of newly transcribed to pre-existing RNA and the correction factor c_lu.</li>
</ul>

You can also define two additional parameters:

<ul>
	<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Labeling time</span><br>
	In the field <span style="font-weight: bold;">Enter time</span> you can enter a custom labeling time 
	for each calculation. You can also enter a constant labeling time in the <a href="menusettings.html">
	Settings</a> menu that will then be used for every calculation.</li>
	
	<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Replicate</span><br>
	Instead of using an average over all replicates (as defined in normalization) you can also use a specific 
	replicate. This is optional; if you prefer the average over all replicates you can just leave the field 
	empty. Again you can enter a constant replicate in the <a href="menusettings.html">Settings</a> menu.</li>
</ul>

Please note that you can not change the half-life methods defined for normalization if you chose 
median-based normalization, because this method only provides one correction factor instead of all three.<br>
An overview over all your chosen parameters and methods can be accessed via the <span style="font-weight: bold;">
Display choices</span> button. In order to start the calculation you have to click the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Start</span> button.

<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Plotting the results</span></h3>
After calculating the half-lives you can plot the results. On the x-axis the half-lives are listed, while the 
y-axis displays the relative frequency of each half-life. For each method that you used, a different 
graph will be generated. You can save a plotting file that contains all values for all methods.
 
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Saving the half-life values</span></h3>
You can save the calculated half-life values via the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Save</span> button. You 
can choose if you want to save only values from one calculation, in combination with one or more attributes,
or save all calculations without attributes. For this last method you can choose between three types of values; 
the half-life values, the ratio values used for these or both. For details on the output format see the 
<a href="../fileformats.html">File formats</a> page.
