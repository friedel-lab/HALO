<h2>Filtering the Data with the GUI</h2>
If you want to use a subset of your data instead of the complete content of the data file, 
you can use the filtering menu in order to reduce the probesets according to a set of 
filtering methods. 

<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Extending the menu</span></h3>
You can access the filtering menu after loading of the data through clicking the menu option 
labeled <span style="font-weight: bold;">Filter Data</span> in the menu bar. 

<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Filtering methods</span></h3>
In the 1.3 version of HALO a set of four different filtering methods is provided. Below you can 
find a short description of their functionality, as well as attributes that might be needed.

<ul>
	<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Threshold</span><br>
	The Threshold-method filters your data according to a numerical threshold. Probesets with 
	at least one RNA value below this threshold will be discarded in this step.</li>
	
	<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Present/Absent calls</span><br>
	This method uses present/absent calls to filter the data. The list of calls has to be loaded 
	as an attribute in a separate file or with the original data. It can also be loaded from the original 
	data file if you did not choose to include these when loading. <br>
	If you choose this method you can choose a <code>call</code> and a <code>threshold</code> for filtering. Your data will be 
	filtered in such a way, that every probeset with at least <code>threshold</code> calls of the type 
	<code>call</code> will be discarded.</li>
	
	<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Probeset quality score - Threshold</span><br>
	This method is based on the quality scores of each probeset. You can enter a numerical threshold, 
	and every probeset with a quality score exceeding this number will be discarded.<br>
	For the calculation of quality scores normalized data is needed; if you have not performed normalization 
	up to this point it will be started automatically. <br>
	You are also provided with the possibility to save the calculated quality scores or plot them in a 
	histogram. 
	
	<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Probeset quality score - Optimal probeset</span><br>
	Like the previous method this filtering method is based on the quality scores. For each gene 
	the probeset with the minimal quality score is kept, all others discarded. The method thus results 
	in one probeset per gene.<br>
	You can limit the calculations to one replicate; otherwise an average over all replicates is used.
	Before using this method normalization has to be performed (see above) and gene names have to be 
	loaded as attribute.<br>
	You can again save the quality scores and create a histogram from them.</li>
</ul>

You can choose more than one of these filtering methods; all methods will be used subsequently in order to 
filter your data. To start the process you have to click the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Start</span> button.
If you are not satisfied with your data you can always repeat filtering with stricter thresholds or other parameters.
Please note that these new filtering steps will then be used <b>additionally</b> to those already performed. If you 
want to restart the complete process, you can reset the data with the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Clear</span>
button. 

<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Saving the data</span></h3>
If you want to save the data after the filtering step you can do this by clicking the <span style="font-weight: bold;">
Save</span> button. In the popup dialog you can then choose all data columns that you want to be included 
in the output file and choose a saving destination as well as a name.

<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Subsequent steps</span></h3>
Filtering is an optional procedure that does not unlock any additional steps.
