<h2>Normalization</h2>
Normalization of transcript quantification data is another possibility to control the quality of the 
data. Based on the relationship between the three groups of RNA, pre-existing, newly transcribed and total RNA, a 
simple linear regression can be performed for normalization 
(<a href="../references.html#tag3">D&ouml;lken et al., 2008</a>). Since pre-existing and newly transcribed transcript 
levels added up should equal total RNA levels, a negative linear correlation should be observed between 
the ratios of newly synthesized/total and pre-existing/total RNA. <br>
If only two of the three RNA fractions have been measured, data can be normalized based on the median 
half-life.
