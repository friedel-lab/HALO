<h2>Half-life calculation</h2>
RNA half-lives can be calculated with HALO using an exponential decay model either for individual 
replicates or ratios averaged across all replicates. Three possible methods exist for the calculation 
of half-lives, based on the newly transcribed/total RNA, pre-existing/total RNA and the newly transcribed/pre-existing RNA ratios, 
respectively. Among these, the method based on newly transcribed (=labeled) to total RNA ratio has an overall high 
accuracy, while the method using pre-existing/total RNA shows high precision for short transcripts, while 
being unreliable for medium-to-long-lived transcripts (<a href="../references.html#tag4">Friedel 
and D&ouml;ken, 2008</a>). The ratio of newly transcribed to pre-existing RNA as a method 
combines the good properties of the two other calculation methods.
