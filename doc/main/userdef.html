<h2>User defined classes</h2>
HALO provides some easy extendable packages so that you can adapt it to best fit your purposes. You can integrate 
new half-life calculation methods, new alpha functions, filtering methods and novel normalization methods. 
 
<h3>Basic procedures</h3>
For most of the user defined extensions you have to write a new Java class that extends or implements a given 
class or interface. For details on these principles see the following sections:
<ul>
	<li><a href="#alpha">Writing your own alpha functions</a></li>
	<li><a href="#filter">Writing your own filtering methods</a></li>
	<li><a href="#norm">Writing your own normalization methods</a></li>
	<li><a href="#half">Writing your own half-life calculation methods</a></li>
	<li><a href="#gui">Making your methods available for the user interface</a></li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="alpha"></a>Writing your own alpha functions</h3>
For the calculation of half-lives you need to use an alpha function. In HALO two different methods are implemented 
for this function: The constant function always returning 1, and the function that models the cell division. However, 
you might like to expand this set of alpha functions. You can do this very easily by following the descriptions below. <br>
You can find the current alpha functions (the classes <code>AlphaConstant</code> and <code>AlphaCellDivision</code>) 
in the package <code>halo.halflife.alpha</code>. If you would like to extend these you have to create a new class 
in this package that implements the interface <code>Alpha</code>. You will have to implement the function 
<code>alpha(t)</code>, but otherwise you can add functions as you like to.<br><br>


<h3><a name="filter"></a>Writing your own filtering methods</h3>
HALO currently provides a set of five different filtering methods: Filtering according to a threshold, according to 
present/absent calls, according to a calculated correction bias or probeset quality control filtering with a 
threshold or for the optimal probeset. You can find these methods in the class <code>halo.data.Filter</code>. If 
you want to implement your own filtering method you can do this directly in the same class or extend this class.
Your method has to take a <code>Data</code> object as an argument and return the filtered <code>Data</code> 
object again. 

<h3><a name="norm"></a>Writing your own normalization methods</h3>
Normalization of your data is an important step in the half-life calculation pipeline. In HALO linear regression is 
implemented as the standard normalization method, and additionally you can perform normalization based on the 
median half-life. This second method is handled in a different way than the standard method and should not serve as 
an example for your own normalization methods. You can find the <code>Normalization</code> class that contains 
all methods that are required for a new normalization method in the package <code>halo.normalization</code>.<br>
If you want to implement your own method, you simply have to extend this class. Methods for the calculation of 
quality control and the generation of a normalization plot are inherited. The most important method is the 
<code>calculateCorrectionFactors()</code> method, which has to be implemented with your own method.

<h3><a name="half"></a>Writing your own half-life calculation methods</h3>
Currently three different methods for half-life calculation are implemented in HALO: The methods are based on 
the ratio of newly transcribed RNA to total RNA, pre-existing RNA to total RNA and newly transcribed RNA to pre-existing RNA, respectively. 
You can find these three classes (<code>HalfLife_New</code>, <code>HalfLife_Pre</code> and <code>HalfLife_NewPre</code>) 
in the package <code>halo.halflife</code>. They are subclasses of <code>HalfLife</code>, which contains every 
necessary method for half-life calculation. If you want to implement your own method you simply have to create 
a new class which extends <code>HalfLife</code>. <br>
You will have to implement the following methods:
<ul>
	<li><code>initialize(Data data)</code></li>
	<li><code>initialize(Data data, int replicate)</code></li>
	<li><code>calculateHalfLives(double t)</code></li>
	<li><code>calculateCorrectionFactors(double medianHWZ, double t)</code></li>
	<li><code>calculateMedianOverReplicates()</code></li>
</ul>
The first two methods serve as initialization where important variables can be set and the ratios can be calculated 
according to your method. For an example of this you can see <code>HalfLife_New</code>. In <code>calculateHalfLives</code>
 you can implement your half-life calculation method and perform the calculation for every given probeset and a 
 given labeling time <code>t</code>. 
The method <code>calculateCorrectionFactors</code> calculates the correction factors based on the median half-life and 
a given labeling time <code>t</code>. If you do not need such a method you can simply leave the body empty. 
In <code>calculateMedianOverReplicates()</code> you have to define how the median over all replicates will be 
calculated.  

<h3>Making your methods available for the user interface</h3>
The two different types of user interfaces, command line and GUI, are currently implemented in such a way that 
they provide easy access to the calculations and methods that come with HALO. If you have extended HALO with your 
own methods and want those to appear in the GUI and command line, you will have to perform some direct changes 
in the code.<br>
<h4>Command line tools</h4>
You will find those tools implemented in the package <code>halo.userinterface.cmdline</code>. If you have implemented 
your own filtering method, you have to adapt the method <code>prepareData(String[] input)</code> in the class 
<code>CmdFilterData</code>. This method takes a set of command line arguments for data loading and handling 
and performs the requested operations. You can add your filtering method here.<br>
<br>
<code>CmdNormalization</code> implements the normalization interface for the command line. Here you can simply add 
your method to the <code>prepareNormalization(Data data)</code> function. <br>
<br>
If you have implemented more half-life calculation methods, you have to adapt the <code>main(String[] args)</code> method 
in the class <code>CmdHalfLife</code>. <br>

<h4>GUI</h4>
The GUI is handled in the classes <code>Gui</code>, <code>GuiFilterData</code>, <code>GuiHalfLife</code> and 
<code>GuiNormal</code> in the package <code>halo.userinterface.gui</code>. If you want your own methods to 
appear as well you will have to change two parts: first, you will have to change the implementation in the
corresponding interface class, so that your method can be used; second, you will have to change the corresponding 
choosing dialogs in the GUI itself, so that the user has the possibility to use your method.<br>
<br>
For a new alpha function you have to change only the GUI, through simply adding a new RadioButton to the dialog 
in <code>actionChooseAlpha()</code> (you will find this in the class <code>Gui</code> and the method <code>
generateMenuListeners()</code>) with a corresponding action listener that sets the alpha function.<br>
<br>
If you have implemented a new filtering method, you have to extend the subpanel <b>Filtering</b>. You can add a 
new RadioButton or CheckBox to the method <code>subMenuFilter</code> in <code>Gui</code> and set the new method 
in the corresponding action listener for the object <code>guiData</code>. This is an object of the class <code>
GuiFilterData</code>, where you have to adapt <code>prepareData()</code> similarly to the command line.<br>
<br>
When you have implemented a new method for normalization, you will have to add a new RadioButton to the 
dialog in the method <code>subMenuNorm</code> in <code>Gui</code> and a corresponding actionlistener that 
transfers the decision to the object <code>guiNorm</code>. The class <code>GuiNormal</code>, of which this 
object is an instance, provides the method <code>calcNormalization</code> that you also have to adapt.<br>
<br>
If you have implemented a new half-life calculation method, you have to add a RadioButton in the method <code>
hlCalculationDialog</code> in <code>Gui</code> and add the method to the <code>guiHL</code> object with an 
actionlistener. This object is an instance of <code>GuiHalfLife</code>, where you also have to adapt the 
method <code>generateHL</code> so that it uses your method if told so.
